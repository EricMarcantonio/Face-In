<h1 id="welcome-to-faceit">Welcome to FaceIt</h1>
<p><strong>FaceIt</strong> is a open source project, dedicated to helping businesses and companies verify and check in human beings using Facial Recognition and some intuition</p>

<h3 id="we-found-a-problem-that-needed-a-cost-effective-solution">We found a problem, that needed a cost-effective solution</h3>
<p><strong>FaceIt</strong> was created because we (the human developers) could not find a free and (almost)<br>
pre-packaged Facial Recognition Software. So we made one ourselves!</p>
